This is the map of schools we have the funding to potentially get transportation for. Please check to see if you are within this shape, and select an option accordingly. (https://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/hannep.j6me9d83/page.html?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiaGFubmVwIiwiYSI6IjYybzlPM2MifQ.JkZw762oCUHD6iNtpHXKBQ#6/41.755/-76.696 for the map)

If you live within the red shape, and you go to a school with at least 8 confirmed hackers, we will be providing your transportation either by picking you up in a chartered bus or by booking you a public transportation ticket. If you are within the shape but aren't part of a group, we will help you try to figure out how to meet another school's transportation.Â Everyone will meet at our awesome new location, AlleyNYC in Manhattan, between 7:30 and 8:30 for registration.

If you are still planning on attending Unhackathon, please pclick one of these links so we know what your plans are:
I live in the red shape, and I am 100% sure I can attend if my transportation is provided. I'll be ready for a phone call from an Unhackathon team member tomorrow!: <%== confirm_url("bus") %>
I'll be handling my own transportation to Unhackathon! :) <%== confirm_url("own") %>

If it turns out you can't attend anymore, click here. <%== cancel_url %>  We'll miss you.

As always, feel free to email any time you have a question about Unhackathon. We can't wait to meet you in September!

Cheers,
Hanne & the Unhackathon Team
