Dear <%== @name %>,

Thank you again for your interest in Unhackathon. We're sorry to say that we won't be able to include high school students in this year's event due to our school's insurance requirements. We loved reading the ideas and thoughts you wrote in your application, though, and hope very much to see you at a future event. 

If you will in fact be at a college this semester (it's an easy mistake to make in the summer!), be sure to write us back right away and we'll fix it.  

We wish you a great hackathon season, and hope to see you at next year's Unhackathon! As always, feel free to write us if you have any questions. 

Sincerely,
The Unhackathon Team
