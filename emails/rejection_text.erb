Dear <%== @name %>,

Thank you again for your interest in Unhackathon. We're sorry to say that we don't have space for you in this year's event. We got hundreds of great applications from hackers all over the country, all with inspiring thoughts and ideas about the future of hackathons, so each decision was a difficult one. 

We wish you a great hackathon season, and hope to see you at next year's Unhackathon! As always, feel free to write us if you have any questions. 

Sincerely,
The Unhackathon Team
