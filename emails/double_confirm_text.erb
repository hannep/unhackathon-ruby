Hey <%== @name %>,

I'm excited to tell you that your application to Unhackathon has been accepted! After reading all your thoughts and ideas in our survey section, we think you're an excellent fit for the event. Congratulations!

We'll be using what you wrote, as well as the answers to the other application questions, to make Unhackathon as great as possible. We've accepted hackers with incredibly diverse backgrounds and interests, and all levels of experience. It's a smart, engaged, and friendly group, so you're bound to make friends and have interesting conversations. Our team of inspiring mentors will also be around to help and advise. We'll be sending updates as the event gets closer to help you get ready for an epic weekend. Remember, applications are still open at www.unhackathon.org, so you still have time to tell your friends and build your team.

First, here's some logistical info. So far we're able to send to pick up anyone who is inside this red shape (click here (https://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/hannep.j6me9d83/page.html?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiaGFubmVwIiwiYSI6IjYybzlPM2MifQ.JkZw762oCUHD6iNtpHXKBQ#6/41.755/-76.696 for the map), and has at least 8 hackers coming from their school. 

Applications are still open, so get your friends and classmates together! If you need any help, be sure to email us.

If you live outside that shape and can't meet us at a school inside it, we're still working on getting your travel put together. Hang tight!

Please go to one of these links so we know what your plans are:
I'm all set! I plan to be on one of the Unhackathon buses: <%== double_confirm_url %>
I want to be there but my school is outside the bus range: <%== cancel_url %>

As always, feel free to email any time you have a question about Unhackathon. We can't wait to meet you in September!

Cheers,
Hanne & the Unhackathon Team
