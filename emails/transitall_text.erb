Hi everyone, 

If you're coming from somewhere other than Stony Brook* or Manhattan** this weekend, don't forget to book your travel to Unhackathon! Because of the late venue change, and some mysterious large event in Montreal that's booking hundreds of buses, we just couldn't get you charter buses. Absolutely none were available, even though we called and emailed about every bus company on the East Coast.

We *will* reimburse you for public bus tickets like Megabus, Bolt Bus, Greyhound, etc. if you buy a ticket and bring your receipt to the event on Saturday. Your bus should arrive between 7 and 9 in the morning. If you can only get an earlier bus, see if you can crash with someone from New York - everyone in this group is friendly.

If your round trip will cost more than $70, or if there isn't a public bus to book and you have another idea to get to Unhackathon, or if you have another concern or question - email our diligent logistics coordinator Rob at robert@unhackathon.org. 

We want more than anything to get everyone safe and happy to Unhackathon - we've been looking forward to meeting you for weeks. We're so bummed that this happened - it was truly out of our hands, and we're doing our best to work around it. Thank you again for all your patience, and for your enthusiasm for Unhackathon!

Love, The Unhackathon Team

*Stony Brook students - yours was the only charter bus we were able to secure. We have one bus available, and it will meet you at 5:30am Saturday on the ticket booth side of the LIRR stop. Its 56 seats are first-come, first-served - we think it will fit everyone, but if we get more people, you can just grab a round trip LIRR ticket right there and get on the 5:47am train. If you do so, or you just prefer the train, we'll reimburse you for your round trip when you check in. 

**Students from the city - Just take the subway to Penn station and walk over. We'll see you between 7:30 and 8:30AM
