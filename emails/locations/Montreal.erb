<p>Your closest bus pickup will be McGill, in Montreal. We’ll be leaving at around 11 PM on Friday night, and you’ll be sharing a bus with students from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. We’ll have official time and place information for you on Wednesday night so you can get ready to go. If your group ends up being smaller than expected, we may instead purchase you tickets for a coach bus.</p>

<p>We are so looking forward to seeing you this Saturday! Hit this giant confirmation button so we know you’ll be there, and we should expect you on your bus. <b>You must confirm by clicking this button, or your space on a bus will not be reserved.</b></p>

<p>If you can no longer attend, we’ll definitely miss you. Click <a href="<%= cancel_url%>">here</a> to cancel and we’ll give your bus seat and space at Unhackathon to someone on the waiting list. If you’ve decided to attend but won’t be using our transportation, please write us back with your plans and we’ll just pass along your bus seat. </p>

<p>As always, if you’ve got any questions, feel free to write us any time.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br>
The Unhackathon Team </p>
