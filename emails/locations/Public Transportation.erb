<p>Because you go to ######, public transportation will be your best option for getting to the city. AlleyNYC is within a five minute walk from Penn Station, so you’ll find it easy to take ##### there on Saturday morning to check in between 7:30 and 8:30am. We’ll send you a schedule that looks good on Wednesday night, but you’re definitely free to look into it beforehand. Your travel to Unhackathon will still be totally free - we’ll be reimbursing your round trip tickets at the event. More info on reimbursements will be coming along with your suggested schedule.</p> 
  
<p>We absolutely can’t wait to see you this Saturday! Hit this giant confirmation button so we know you’ll be there, and we should expect you on your bus. <b>You must confirm by clicking this button, or your space on a bus will not be reserved.</b></p>

<p>If you can no longer attend, we’ll definitely miss you. Click here to cancel and we’ll give your space at Unhackathon to someone on the waiting list. </p>

<p>As always, if you’ve got any questions, feel free to write us any time. </p>

<p>Cheers,<br>
The Unhackathon Team</p>
