<p>Your closest bus pickup will be Philadelphia, PA. We’ll be leaving at around 5 AM on Saturday morning, and you’ll be sharing a bus with students from Bryn Mawr College, Swarthmore College, Georgetown University, Howard University and University of Maryland. We’ll have official time and place information for you on Wednesday night so you can get ready to go. If your group ends up being smaller than expected, we may instead reimburse you for tickets for a coach bus.</p>

<p>We are so looking forward to seeing you this Saturday! Hit this giant confirmation button so we know you’ll be there, and we should expect you on your bus. <b>You must confirm by clicking this button, or your space on a bus will not be reserved.</b></p>

<p>If you can no longer attend, we’ll definitely miss you. Click <a href="<%= cancel_url%>">here</a> to cancel and we’ll give your bus seat and space at Unhackathon to someone on the waiting list. If you’ve decided to attend but won’t be using our transportation, please write us back with your plans and we’ll just pass along your bus seat. </p>

<p>As always, if you’ve got any questions, feel free to write us any time.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br>
The Unhackathon Team </p>
