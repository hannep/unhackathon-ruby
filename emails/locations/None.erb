<p>Your school is outside our bus range, so we can’t provide your transportation. In order to attend, you can meet up with students from a school within the red shape on unhackathon.org/map or book your own transportation. We hope you’ll be able to make it! </p>

<p>If you can still attend Unhackathon, we’re so looking forward to seeing you this Saturday. Hit this giant confirmation button so we know you’ll be there. </p>

<p>If you can no longer attend, we’ll definitely miss you. Click here to cancel and we’ll give your space at Unhackathon to someone on the waiting list. </p>

<p>As always, if you’ve got any questions, feel free to write us any time. </p>

<p>Cheers,<br>
The Unhackathon Team</p>
